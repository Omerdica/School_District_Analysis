# School_District_Analysis

# Overview 
  In this challange we are tasked with helping Maria figure out student funding and standarizied testing based on the schools in her district. However due to some dishonety in standarized testing we have to look at the data again and try figure out as to what happened and which school was effected by this. 



## Results
